               My parents are amazing, they did everything they could for me and often even if I didn't realize it they made many
               sacrifices for my life and sake. Both of my parents are supprotive of my career and have gave me validation for my
               acomplishments I have been able to do. My mom a very timed-scared women doesn't let her emotions get in the way of
               doing whatever it takes to take care of her sons and puts her full efrort into understanding us. My dad made many
               sacrafices to get the recources to get his sons to have a better life than he could have, he also has a very good
               sense of humor and knows how to make light and bright any bad or tough situation. I love them both and glad I was
               able to have supporting parents like them growing up.
