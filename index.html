    <h3>my day was long, I had a 8 hour car ride and got to the dorm to drop off my stuff then went to explore.
        <br> My family & I ate buffalo Wild Wings then went to my dorm to drop off all my stuff.
        <br> When I got back We had dinner and I got to meet some friends then went out to get snacks. 
        <br> The day ended with a broken AC so I got my own room</h3>
