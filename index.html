    My highschool was very small in the basemnet of a church, it was called Academia Avance Charter
    The school was mostly Hispanic and very pursistant on family so they often had many gathers with familys
    and had a deep connection with each individual student. I was one student who had every connection
    I was very connected with all of my teachers and almost all the staff, some more than others. I also had an
    internship with the school IT
