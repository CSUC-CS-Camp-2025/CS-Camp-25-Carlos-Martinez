                I'm an 18-year-old incoming Computer Science major at CSU Chico.
                I come from Highland Park, a small town not too far from Los Angeles. I attended a
                small family charter school called Academia Avance, where I tried to give my all to the school, my
                academics, and especially the people there—students, teachers, and staff. I am Mexican-Hispanic with a
                large extended family, and although I'm not as connected with them as I'd like to be, I continue to try.

                My high school was very small and located in the basement of a church. It was called Academia Avance
                Charter.
                The school was mostly Hispanic and placed a strong emphasis on family, often hosting gatherings with
                families and building deep connections with each individual student. I was one of those students who
                built strong relationships. I was very connected with all of my teachers and most of the staff—some more
                than others. I also had an internship with the school's IT department.

                Shady is my first official dog, and I got her when I was 17. She's a purebred Schnauzer and was the
                smallest of her litter.
                Along with her, my older brother got one of her siblings, and they constantly play together. She gets
                very attached and excited whenever she sees people she likes.

                    <li>She's very energetic and doesn't know when to clam down</li>

                Yeraldin Colin is my girlfriend of three years, since our sophomore year of high school.
                We've known each other and been friends since 7th grade in middle school. We were supposed to go to CSU
                Chico together, but we decided to attend different schools and support each other as we follow our own
                career paths from afar..<ui>

                My parents are amazing. They did everything they could for me and, even when I didn't realize it, made
                many sacrifices for my well-being and future. Both of my parents are supportive of my career and have
                always validated the accomplishments I've been able to achieve.

                My mom, a very timid and cautious woman, doesn't let her emotions get in the way of doing whatever it
                takes to care for her sons. She puts her full effort into understanding us. My dad made many sacrifices
                to provide the resources his sons needed for a better life than he had. He also has a great sense of
                humor and knows how to lighten and brighten any tough situation.

                I love them both and am truly grateful to have grown up with such supportive parents.

                I have three older brothers—David, Vick, and Danny (from left to right). My brothers have been a massive
                support not just in my plans for college or my future career, but throughout my entire life, no matter
                the situation I've faced.

                Even though we've had some issues in the past and didn't always have the strongest bond, as I grow older
                and begin to face the real world, I'm grateful to have them supporting me every step of the way into
                adulthood. Their tough love and deeply earned affection have helped me mature and take life more
                seriously. I'm forever grateful that they are my brothers.
